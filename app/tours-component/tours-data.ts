      description: "Kaka’ako was once once a thriving community with agricultural terraces, taro plantations, salt ponds and home to docks for foreign ships. Also, many ali’i called this place home. Today, Kaka’ako is one of the fastest growing neighborhoods in all of Oahu. There are several examples of places in Kaka’ako currently undergoing construction and development that can be seen by everyday pedestrians. These recent developments will likely price out many of the people who have called Kaka’ako home and make living their possible for only those who can afford it. Along with the rising cost of living, these new urban developments will destroy the cultural significance and history of Kaka’ako that was once present in the community.",

      description: "There is a growing concern with human rights in Hawaii today, which is integrally connected to the impact of tourism on Native Hawaiian’s and their communities. The problem as a whole is tourism, but to be more precise, sports tourism. What’s problematic is how the sports tourism industry seems to have little or no regard to the well-being of the Hawaiian community.",

      description: "The Native Hawaiians suffered/continue to suffer a tremendous injustice. The atrocities committed by the American government will sorely be felt throughout many, many generations. One of the more prominent wounds that poses a more significant risk to the future of all of Hawai’i is the misappropriation of natural resources, wai (water) in particular. Due to the utilization of western’s influence in the management of wai in place of traditional, Hawaiian sustainable practices, impending consequences looms around Hawai’i’s future.",
