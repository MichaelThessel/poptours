Ala Wai Canal In 1921 Walter F.  Dillingham's, Hawaiian Dredging Company was responsible for Dredging 2.4 million yards of coral, dirt, and sand from Waikiki.  This very act of dredging the Ali Wai In turn left many native Hawaiian's homeless, because of the increase in property taxes.  The Ala Wai Canal starts from the streams in pololo valley as well as Manoa valley and goes to the Pacific Ocean.  The Ala Wai finally was completed in 1928, but the repercussions of the Ala Wai are still present.  Currently the Ala Wai is still a health problem.  Today the canal cannot be used for crabbing, fishing, or swimming, because of how polluted the water has become.  Before the Ala Wai was dredged it was once actually marshland used by native Hawaiians to grow rice and taro crops.

Pearl Harbor Once named Wai Momi meaning “waters of Pearl” was once known for being the home of Pu'uloa.  Pu'uloa is known for being the shark goddess in Ancient Hawaiian culture.  Today Majority of people does not know Pearl Harbor for its ancient Hawaiian history, because of Americas overshadowing history of Pearl Harbor.  When thinking of Pearl Harbor most would think of the attack on Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941 where 2,300 Americans lost their lives.  That being said there is much more to pearl harbor than that of a tragic day on Dec 7th.  Sense 1887 Pearl Harbor has been used as a coal station for ships leading up to the end of Hawaiian overthrow in 1898.  Two years after the end of the Hawaiian over throw in 1900 the harbor was dredged approximately 35 feet deep lengthwise of the Harbor.  The harbor has sense been dredged a lot in the years, but one of the biggest dredging projects was In 1908 when the Hawaiian Dredging Company helped dredge a 6.2 million dollar project to further dredge Pearl Harbor deeper and wider to accommodate for more ships.  The port of Pearl Harbor has been a key factor for the United States navy and still today Pearl Harbor is occupied by the US.

Kaneohe Bay Kaneohe Bay is located in the North Eastern shore of Oahu and has been a site for intensive studies concerning coral reef and ocean ecosystems.  It has been a staple for the people of Hawaii since Polynesians first arrived over 700 years ago.  It served as a highly functional fishpond and agricultural/aquaponics resource supporting a large population of Native Hawaiians.  With the arrival of European settlers in 1778 the Bay experienced significant change with the further introduction of foreign plants and animals.  Increased immigration lead to population growth and the development of European style plantation and agricultural systems and an end to the Native traditional practices of land and water management.  Reefs were devastated by extensive dredge operations with the urbanization of the islands.  In 1960, Kaneohe Bay was severely impacted by the increase in sewage and sedimentation due to improper grading and stream channeling which lead to an extensive loss of coral coverage.  Today factors such as tourism and recreational activities have greatly impacted these reefs and caused devastation to the ecosystem.  Coral bleaching began to occur in 1996 with the most severe episode occurring in 2014.  Visitors as well as residents that use sunscreen or fertilizers unknowingly aid in this destruction.  According to a recent study, Chemicals in 1 drop of sunscreen is enough to damage a fragile coral reef system.  A rise in globalization and fossil fuel emissions that lead to higher temperatures also take their toll on these reefs that were used to sustain the Native people and the ecosystem they regarded.  While this is a dire situation, fortunately for Kaneohe Bay, active research and awareness are helping keep these coral alive.  It is through avid awareness to tourist as well as to the residents to be mindful of their impact on these ecosystems (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4435448/">link</a>).

Waianae Coast Ordnance Reef Ordnance Reef is located on the Leeward side of Oahu and extends over an area of approximately 1 x 0.5 nautical miles.  The nearest cities that this site affects are Waianae and Maili.  In 1992, the City and County of Honolulu Department of Wastewater Management's oceanographic crew unearthed munitions between 0.3 to 0.6 miles northwest of the sewage outfall diffuser (munitions that were presumably associated with World War II).  Military munitions were also found just south of the sewage diffuser and Hawaii designated Fish Haven.  The Army itself does not even know the actual amount of munitions that are currently in the waters or to what extent this impact has on the marine life.  The military is only now taking a closer look as to what health implications the chemicals may have had on humans as well.  This site is now a detriment to the local denizens residing in Waianae and Maili having one of the largest populations of Native Hawaiians on the island.  Local residents have seen these munitions for generations off of the Waianae Coast.  (<a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/7102632/closer-%C2%AD%E2%80%90to-%C2%AD%E2%80%90cleanup-%C2%AD%E2%80%90of-%C2%AD%E2%80%90dumped-%C2%AD%E2%80%90munitions-%C2%AD%E2%80%90in-%C2%AD%E2%80%90our-%C2%AD%E2%80%90waters">link</a> .  According to NOAA, there are two concerns regarding water pollution that have occurred here.  Firstly, the water quality appears to have been tainted in the southernmost part of the Waianae Coast probably due to runoff associated with the development occurring at Barber's Point, Pearl and Honolulu Harbor).  Secondly, there is cause for concern along the shoreline where groundwater percolation may be occurring.  This is a compromising situation that affects not only the people that live there currently, but also the endangered marine life that reside in the waters there as well (i.e.  coral reefs, Humpback Whales, Hawaiian Monk Seals, Hawksbill Turtles, and much more).

Makua Military Reservation The Makua Military Reservation is a training facility that is located on the Leeward side of Oahu.  The Military took the first region of land in Makua for training practice in 1929 and increased in their occupation with the addition of the Makua and Kahanahaiki valleys to serve as training regions.  Landowners in the area were given payment for their land, while many of the Hawaiians residing there were evicted against their will.  One story that was noted of this time (Kelly, “Cutural History”) was that after all of the denizens were evicted, including the Minister of the Makua Protestant Church.  The military painted a white cross on the roof of the church along with other buildings and proceeded to bomb them, taking with them the tombstones in its cemetery along with the connections of the residents to their ancestors (<a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~georgann/makua">link</a>).  Not only did this have a crippling affect on the people, but a serious affect on the land itself.  Once an area that supported one of the earliest settlements on Oahu (imu found dating back to 1200 AD when Hawaiians were thought to inhabit the islands circa 1500-­‐2000AD) with a thriving agricultural system now lays barren.  While the West Coast of Oahu is one of the hottest areas of the island, some studies attest this to the absence of the agricultural cultivation that the Native Hawaiians once thrived upon.  Other kupuna say that this area was once Wahi Pana meaning incredibly sacred or taboo.  Till this day, there are locals who are concerned about this test ground and what goes on behind these facilities.  On April 6, 2015, a blast left two employees injured after an explosion keeping those around the area questionable about activities.

H‐3 and Kukuiokane Heiau The H-­‐3, the 16mile freeway that connects Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Pu'uloa to the Marine Corps Base on Mokapu was completed in 1997 but not without heated contention.  The tunnel runs through the Ko'olaus and the Halawa interchange.  There were several sacred lands that this infrastructure bore through.  It was originally proposed in 1960 as part of federally-­‐funded interstate defense highways to facilitates troops and equipment for enhanced transportation during World War II.  However, this was always a sacred land even prior to the 18th century when Kamehameha the Great used this land as a meeting location for his ali'i.  (<a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dennisk/texts/h32007.html">link</a>).  So for many Native Hawaiians, the $1.3 billion project was a symbol of destruction and devastation to their culture.  Much of the construction and destruction done to the native lands were launched prior to investigation of cultural significance.  Kukuiokane Heiau in Kaneohe however, was a site that was beyond arguable.  The Heiau originally dedicated to Kane, the Hawaiian god of agriculture, deemed one of the largest heiaus on the island now lies decimated under tons of the H-­‐3 concrete.  This is one of many of the Native Hawaiian sacred sites, burials grounds, and agricultural remains that was a lost to the Hawaiian people and Hawaiian culture itself.

Leina a ka ‘Uahe site in Kalaleo-­‐Ancient Kanehili The Leina a ka ‘Uhane site in Kalaleloa was listed by the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART) Federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) as a National Register Eligible.  To Polynesians, this was a spiritual launching point of souls back to their home in Tahiti.  This is an area that is now being subject to bulldozing and destruction.  No archaeological surveys or supervision was done prior to these caves and streams being bulldozed to create roads which caused irreversible damage to the trail that is hundreds possibly thousands of years old.  This is a clear demonstration of how modernization tramples over the sacrality of the land and the culture of the indigenous people.  The government needs to work to understand that this is a cultural dwelling spot for the people and more awareness needs to be given to these issues so the Hawaiians do not lose the connection to the land and the past of their people.

Kawailoa North Shore Oahu Kamehameha Schools indirectly leased a total of 1,033 acres to Monsanto, one of the top biotech giants in today's agricultural industry.  Although Kamehameha Schools did not originally lease the land to the current and controversial Monsanto Company, since 1999, the original lessee sold their interest and gave their share to Monsanto.  (<a href="http://www.ksbe.edu/land/faq/">link</a>).  Many residents are concerned about the runoff of the crops into the oceans as well as what health effects this may have on the people, the land, and the ocean.  Many have been coining Hawaii as the term “Ground Zero for GMOs”.  Recently, Monsanto sent a permission slip with students at Waialua Elementary School home with them to attempt to gain community support along with the added intention of using the photos of the children in publications for GMO with the legal ability to “edit” their statements.  This is a pressing issue that directly faces our current policies in place and fully illustrates how corporate gain can affect the lives of citizens that are the ones to face the challenges it presents to them everyday.
