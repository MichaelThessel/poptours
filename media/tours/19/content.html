<p>Hawaii is seen asparadise by everyone, or is it? When we evaluate Hawaii, as withanything else, it is important to remember that our view of somethingis very subjective. Many people can look at the same thing and seecompletely different things, especially when we look at differentparts of the same thing. The land of Hawaii is no different. Acollege student, like myself, might go to UH Manoa, drive or bus toAla Moana or Ward to hang out with friends, eat out at a restaurant,then go home to study and go to sleep. A tourist from Asia or themainland might have a very different experience of Hawaii. However,for a family of four living in a park in a tent, not having eaten awarm meal since last week, worried about police coming to kick themout of the park and take their stuff, living in &ldquo;paradise&rdquo;might be quite different. This tour is to reveal the hidden (meaningactively pushed into the shadows and margins) side of Hawaii.</p>
<p>In front of NextSteps Shelter &ndash; The Next Steps Shelter is quite out of the wayfrom everything else around. It is behind the University of Hawaii&rsquo;sJohn A. Burns School of Medicine, as part of a warehouse that is usedby Reuse Hawaii, a sort of recycling center. This first stop isperhaps the most important. We should ask ourselves the politicalquestion, why are our shelters pushed far into the corners of theland, away from most of society? Is this intentional, practical,and/or preferable?</p>

<p>Next Steps Mainliving quarters &ndash; This is where most of the people inhabitingthe shelters live. Here the quarters are made of cubicles about fourfeet high and covered with bed sheets. There is no door and privacyis extremely limited. The cubicles are sectioned off into units forfamilies with children, couples, single women, and single men. Thisshelter was set up in no more than a week&rsquo;s time and wasexpected to only last for 6 months before the company that owns thespace would repurpose the area for something else. Two years later,the shelter still has a temporary appearance and no motion towardsmaking the fixtures more permanent have been made.</p>

<p>	Next Steps Shelterpantry and back storage area &ndash; This is an area where most ofthe supplies and food are stored. The inhabitants are restricted fromaccessing this area, and only staff or volunteers can come back hereto bring it out to the people. Everything from bed sheets, clothing,and even toys for the children are stored back here. The staff andvolunteers here work very hard, and they are sordidly understaffed.However, if we challenge ourselves to flip our perspectives how dothe shelter inhabitants see this area? How do we see the politics ofthe shelter? Are they participants in the politics or are theysubjects?</p>
<p>Ala Moana Blvd +OppPunchbowl St. Bus Stop (minor) &ndash; This is about a quarter of amile from the shelter and is the nearest bus stop to the shelter.Relative to other shelters it might be a rather short distance.However, when you think about the path we just came from you mightimagine the anxiety that would come with walking this sparsely litpath at night.</p>
<p>Across fromRestaurant Row (minor) &ndash; This stop is to illustrate how astructure, in this case Ala Moana Blvd, is used to segregate thehomeless from the commercial area.</p>
<p>UH JABSOM (minor)&ndash;This stop will be used to show people how close in proximityinstitutions of higher learning, state funded education is to manypeople, and yet they cannot access it. People are not separated by alarge spans of space, but yet they are kept separate in society.</p>

<p>Ohe St. &ndash;Recently the Honolulu Police Department did a &ldquo;sweep&rdquo; ofthe Kakaako Waterfront Park region, clearing out homeless inhabitantsand seizing their belongings. Police raids of homeless communitiesare often done at night, suddenly without warning. When thought aboutfrom the perspective of the people evicted, we can see how thehomeless are being treated as criminals where their civil libertieshave been denied unjustly. However, the criminalization anddiscrimination does not stop there. In a special on homelessness byHawaii News Now portrayed homeless people as dirty, irresponsible,and a burden on society. News media is perhaps one of the main waysin which our image of the homelessness issue has been framed in theminds of the public majority.</p>

<p>Kakaako Children&rsquo;sDiscovery Center &ndash; A place of parties, field trips, andentertainment, placed right in the middle of a collection of tentsinhabited by people who are homeless. This is a place where the issueof homelessness becomes harder to ignore. Families with smallchildren often come to the Discovery Center to give their kids a funeducational experience. Yet, on the way to the Center, it isimpossible to avoid a few tents pitched under the nearby trees.However, the parents move past the tents as though they wereinvisible, and the children excited about spending a day playingsubconsciously follow the adults&rsquo; example and ignore thehomeless people. So in the end it is not only the fault of the statethat is pushing away the homeless populations out of the line ofsight. This stop shows that even when the homeless are visible, weoften choose to not see the painful side of paradise that is right infront of us.</p>
