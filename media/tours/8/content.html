<ol> <li/>
McKinley Statue <ol type="a"> <li/>
The statue of McKinley at McKinley High school shows him holding a document that says &ldquo;Treaty of Annexation&rdquo; which is a document that doesn&rsquo;t exist. <li/>
Hawaii was illegally annexed through the Join Resolution. <li/>
This document eventually help Hawaii become a state. </ol></ol>
<ol start="2"> <li/>
Iolani Palace <ol type="a"> <li/>
This was where the unlawful overthrow happened. The Committee of Safety, a group who wanted to annex Hawaii, tricked the U.S. troops to surround the palace while the Queen was making a new constitution to bring more power to the Hawaiians. The queen surrendered to the Committee of Safety to avoid bloodshed and the Honolulu Rifles declared a provisional government. </ol></ol><br/>

Pearl Harbor <ol type="a"> <li/>
The main base for naval operations. Hawaii was in the middle of the pacific which is a good strategic point to place a base for war around the Pacific. <li/>

Schofield Barracks Firing Range <ol type="a"> <li/>
Depleted Uranium was found at the firing ranges of Schofield Barracks. <li/>
Depleted Uranium (DU) is a byproduct of the nuclear energy and atomic weapon industries.   <li/>
When DU is fired, it creates tiny particles of aerosolized DU oxide that is carried by the wind. If it gets into the water, it can significantly affect the islands. <li/>
Military bombed the fire range which possibly spread the DU oxide. </ol></ol><br/>

Tanks are routinely checked to extend the expected use of the tank for 20 years. <li/>
On January 13, 2014, tank 5 had a leakage after it had pass inspections a few years before. <li/>
There were multiple tests on the drinking water of the communities around Red Hill for potential contamination but none was found. </ol> <li/>
