<h4>Major locations</h4>
<p>Lanikai  As you can see by this picture Lanikai used to be little more than a dirt road and a few thatch wood houses. Past its small town marking pillar there are Multimillion dollar houses, a golf course and in my opinion the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. Kailua has the 2nd most expensive rates for housing on the island and most of these properties are located in the Lanilkai area (homeshoppehawaii.com).  Unfortunately, nowadays even though it is a public beach, the community has strictly enforced laws about people not being able to park their making it an extremely difficult place to get to unless you live there. This is another example of public resources being taken away from the public in favor of supporting the more affluent.</p>

<p>Kapaa Quarry  An article in in 1940, the Army made a deal to facilitate their own dumping at the location in exchange they would maintain this portion themselves. Although they failed to do this forcing the responsibility to the already over encumbered state who was unable to take care of this problem. This caused work to pile up on both front On top of the already issue growing out of control. This caused this area to be further gentrified now both by the state and military. This is an example of the military and government support the degradation of “unfavorable” locations in Kailua. This puts the needs of the military and government above the needs of the people which is an example of natural resource gentrification. </p>

<p>Kailua Shopping Center  This Andy’s restaurant used to be the biggest structure on Oneawa Street. It was a family owned restaurant that family had enjoyed going to. If you were to standing on the corner of this block next to the Andy’s sign and look to your right you would see nothing but local family owed restaurants and business locations.  Today the street and shopping centers are filled with expensive mainland business stores like whole foods and CPK. Local department stores like Don Quiote were pushed way for bigger businesses like Target making the Kailua back home seem more and more like a second Waikiki. This is an example of how the gentrification affect local businesses. </p>

<p>Kalaheo High School  Entering Kailua through Mokapu Boulevard is Kalaheo High school, home of the mustangs. Kalaheo was established in 1973 (arch.k12) US News considers Kalaheo public school on the island with a 36.1 college readiness index, Reading proficiency of 76%  and a Math proficiency of 44%. It is also a school that has 40% white enrollment which is the majority in this school. This high school reports that they have 27% finically disadvantaged students (US news). This proves that the high school with kids who have less financial need are getting a better education. This suits the richer and middle class communities and therefore promotes gentrification.  </p>

<p>Kailua High School  About a 13min drive 2.6 miles away is from Kalaheo is Kailua High school (Google maps).  This high school is in a lower income district of Kailua. This high schools general admittance are poorer as evidenced by its Title 1 funding (US News). It also has a 68% Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders and has a %88 total minority enrollment. A total of 54% of the students are Economically Disadvantaged. Comparing this to Kalaheo it is very interesting to see how money and racial background correlates with successfulness in school. This is proof of gentrification going on in Kailua even as far as the public school system.</p>

<h4>Minor location</h4>
<p>My house My house is worth about $900,000. This may seem great but these extremely expensive conditions have forced me and 12 other family member (15 if include the dogs) to live in the same house. My mom will most likely be paying this off for the rest of her life. We are one of many examples of this happening to local families in Hawaii. Our living situation is a result of the housing gentrification and now it takes a whole houseful of people to afford one house. </p>

<p>Triangle park- This is a really nice well serviced park in a small million dollar town in Lanikai. Once me and my friends were hanging out there late at night like a lot of the neighborhood kids did. We were approached by someone who heard us at the park and said we weren’t allowed to play there because were not from there and she would call the Cops on us if we did leave. My friends and I were treated differently just because we weren’t from around the rich side of Kailua.</p>

<p>Kailua district park- This park is in the middle of town and is always seems to be either condemned or in poor condition. The Community Center also looks worse for ware and is hardly maintained. I believed this because it is built in a more middle public area of Kailua. Triangle Park and Kailua Park are perfect examples of gentrification in the community.</p>
