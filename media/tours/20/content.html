<p>When most people think of Hawaii, they envision an island paradise, but not everyone is lucky enough to think so optimistically. Hawaii has a problem that legislators and businesses wish to sweep under the rug and out of the tourists' eyes: Houselessness. (This tour refers to the issue as &quot;houselessness&quot; rather than &quot;homelessness&quot; because Hawaii is a home for all who choose to live here, whether or not they have a house.) Well over seven thousand Hawaii residents are houseless, giving the state a per capita houselessness rate of 487 per 100,000 people (Bussewitz). This means Hawaii has the highest houselessness rate in the entire country. More shocking than these numbers is our local and state governments' response to this human tragedy. For years, the City and County of Honolulu, along with the State of Hawaii, has chosen to criminalize poverty and harass Hawaii's houseless population with sit-lie bans and &quot;sweeps&quot; that displace and traumatize the most vulnerable members of our community. If Hawaii is to live up to its reputation as the Aloha state, it must adopt &quot;housing first&quot; policies that give houseless people stable residences as a first priority, increase funding for houseless outreach and support programs, and provide facilities for houseless people to maintain their dignity as they search for stable housing. For this to happen, Hawaii must change the way it thinks about the houseless, viewing them not as bums or nuisances, but as people just as deserving of healthy and happy lives as the rest of us. Fundamentally, we should treat the houseless with compassion. This walking tour will guide people through the streets of downtown Honolulu, exploring the current and former battlegrounds on which the fight for the rights and dignity of houseless people has taken place.  </p>

<h3>Major Stops</h3>
<h4>Hawaii State Capitol</h4>
<p>The seat of the state government and the location of the governor's office, the Capitol is where Governor Ige declared a state of emergency for the houselessness crisis. This emergency proclamation induced the state to build a transitional housing facility, extend contracts for houseless service providers, and increase funding for Housing First initiatives (Governor's Office News Release: Governor Ige Signs Emergency Proclamation to Address Homelessness Statewide.&quot;&nbsp;). These are all steps in the right direction; Housing First has been shown to be an effective method of addressing houselessness; it recognizes that stable housing is a necessary precondition for the success of other efforts such as mental health treatment and job training (Kunkle). It is heartening to see the state adopt this approach, and it should be successful in its fight against houselessness if it sticks with it. However, Governor Ige has also done, and continues to do, significant damage to the houseless by orchestrating the sweeps of state lands that have displaced hundreds. These &quot;homeless sweeps&quot; are marketed as &quot;compassionate disruption&quot; efforts designed to guide houseless people into shelters, but in reality, the houseless face displacement and the confiscation of indispensible property including medication and identification documents. Governor Ige wants to make these destructive sweeps an everyday occurrence for the houseless; he requested $1.6 million to create a task force dedicated to conducting sweeps (Kaneya). The governor has the power to end this counterproductive and damaging practice, and he owes it to the community to do so.  </p>
<h4>Honolulu Hale</h4>
<p>The seat of the city and county government, Honolulu Hale is where the City Council passed and Mayor Caldwell signed into law Bill 42, the &quot;sit-lie ban&quot; that made it illegal for anyone to sit or lie on Waikiki sidewalks. The City Council later extended the ban to include certain areas of Chinatown. This law has effectively criminalized houselessness, subjecting violators to a potential $1000 fine or 30 days in jail (Cocke). The purported effectiveness of this ban at getting roofs over the heads of houseless people, the only true way to solve this crisis, has been conclusively disproven by a University of Hawaii study that found it merely forces houseless people to move to other areas of Honolulu. (Gill). The law does nothing but punish the poor for being poor and push houseless people out of Waikiki so that tourists do not notice them.  It is a textbook example of the marginalization of a vulnerable subset of the population. The City and County must acknowledge its responsibility for the damage it has done to Hawaii's most vulnerable residents, and it must work with the state government to support the houseless population it currently criminalizes. The City Council must repeal the sit-lie ban. To let this ineffective and discriminatory policy stand would be to admit that the city and county cares only about revenue from tourism and thinks of Hawaii's houseless population as an obstacle to these profits.  </p>
<h4>Aala Park</h4>
<p>(NOTE: Houselessness is an extremely sensitive issue, and many houseless people reside in Aala Park. This tour is not intended to help people gawk at the houseless. If you choose to go to Aala Park, please be very respectful.) In the past, Aala Park was known as a gathering place for political rallies and family gatherings, but it has become known in recent times for the houseless people who live in it. Local media has pushed the narrative that it has been taken over by large numbers of mentally unstable homeless people -- but this is an unfair and biased assessment of the situation. Rather, Aala Park serves as proof of Hawaii's failure to treat its houseless population with dignity and respect. It has become a gathering place for Hawaii's houseless because of disruptive sweeps and Hawaii's failure to provide adequate mental health services for the poor. Mass media has the power to drastically influence public opinion of the issues it reports on, and Hawaii's news organizations have consistently portrayed the houseless as a scourge on the island rather than as human beings who are down on their luck. It has run stories about local residents &quot;taking back&quot; the park from &quot;street people&quot; who have taken it over (Hillyer). This frames the crisis of houselessness as an issue pitting members of the community against the houseless, who are cast as unwelcome invaders. Where is the aloha? The houselessness crisis will not be solved by further demonizing and alienating those who are not fortunate enough to have a house to call their own. I ask again, where is the aloha for the houseless?  </p>
<h4>Chinatown</h4>
<p>The large number of houseless people living on the streets of Chinatown had created a public sanitation problem; there were no facilities open to the public where houseless people could relieve themselves and keep themselves hygienic and presentable. This issue led Chinatown's businesses and residents to complain about the persistent smell of human waste in the streets. To be clear, Chinatown's houseless residents did not choose to relieve themselves in the streets, as there was simply nowhere else for them to go. To address this issue, and as an example of the correct approach to mitigating the houselessness crisis, the city opened a hygiene center on North Pauahi Street, providing clean toilets, showers, and toiletries.  giving houseless individuals the opportunity to maintain their personal hygiene, and with it, their dignity. This facility is staffed by Mental Health Kokua, a nonprofit mental health service organization, to ensure that it is clean, well-stocked, and safe (Namata). This is a win-win situation; Chinatown's streets are sanitary and much more pleasant to walk through, and houseless individuals now have a clean, safe place to attend to their needs.  Hawaii should open more of these hygiene centers and should adopt this sort of compassionate attitude in all aspects of its response to the houselessness crisis. This should be the norm, not the exception to the norm.</p>
<h4>Hawaii Public Housing Authority</h4>
<p>The Hawaii Public Housing Authority administers state and federal public housing programs that place needy individuals and families into rental houses. It also operates a rent supplement program that assists qualifying people with paying their monthly rent, along with job training and GED programs (Hawaii Public Housing Authority). The Authority is thus one of the primary actors both in placing needy and houseless people in housing and keeping people out of the streets in the first place by helping them to pay for their existing housing. However, these public housing programs are inadequate for dealing with Hawaii's houselessness crisis; its 6,195 units are simply not nearly enough to meet the demand for affordable housing. Because of this, both state and federal housing programs have extremely long wait lists; the average family applying for housing today can expect to wait between two and seven years before being placed in a unit (Hawaii Public Housing Authority) -- an absolute eternity if the only other option is being houseless.  Moreover, the condition of the housing projects themselves leaves much to be desired. Over 400 units sit empty because they are damaged or neglected to the point that they are uninhabitable. The Public Housing Authority has had issues maintaining the units to comply with federal standards, which include &quot;hot and cold running water as well as working bathrooms, electrical systems and smoke detectors&quot; (Hofschneider). These are very basic requirements for habitability, and yet the state has trouble meeting them. It is estimated that Hawaii's public housing units will need $820 million of repairs over the next ten years, an incredible amount of money. However, Governor Ige requested only $5 million for repairs for 2015. Hawaii must drastically increase funding for its public housing projects, even if it means raising taxes to do so. Surely, it is worth it, if it means getting people into houses.  </p>
<h3>Minor Stops</h3>
<h4>University of Hawaii Medical School</h4>
<p>(NOTE: See note for Aala Park. This part of Kakaako is home to many houseless people. Be respectful.) The streets near the John A. Burns School of Medicine in Kakaako were the site of a high profile sweep in 2015 that targeted houseless people living in the area. This sweep displaced nearly three hundred people; service providers were on hand to offer shelter to affected individuals and families, but many were unable or unwilling to enter shelters. Since then, many people have returned to the area, but sweeps continue to displace them.  </p>
<h4>Institute for Human Services</h4>
<p>The Institute for Human Services is one of the largest social service organizations on Oahu. It provides services ranging from emergency shelters to healthcare services and community outreach. While it has been criticized for its strict shelter policies, the IHS remains one of the foremost entities providing services to the houseless. While Hawaii's city and state governments must redouble their efforts to aid Hawaii's houseless, charitable nongovernmental organizations will always be called upon to provide much-needed help.</p>
<h4>Legal Aid Society of Hawaii</h4>
<p>The Legal Aid Society offers legal assistance to Hawaii's needy clients, helping them navigate a legal system that is often dismissive of their needs. It is difficult to get access to justice without a substantial amount of money, and legal issues can often force people out onto the street. As long as legal representation remains out of reach of Hawaii's least fortunate, the Legal Aid Society and lawyers offering pro bono services will remain integral parts of Hawaii's legal landscape.  </p>
