<p>Especially over the
past sixty years, Hawai&rsquo;i has experienced major urban
developments in places that used to be rich in cultural significance
to Native Hawaiians.  One of the main neighborhoods recently going
through this change is Kaka&rsquo;ako. Kaka&rsquo;ako or formerly
known as Kewalo was once once a thriving community with agricultural
terraces, taro plantations, salt ponds and home to docks for foreign
ships. Also, many ali&rsquo;i called this place home. Today, Kaka&rsquo;ako
is one of the fastest growing neighborhoods in all of Oahu. There are
several examples of places in Kaka&rsquo;ako currently undergoing
construction and development that can be seen by everyday residents
and tourists. The Hawaii Community Development Authority has planned
to continue to build new structures that will provide the area will
luxury condominiums, business space, and restaurants. These recent
developments will likely price out many of the people who have called
Kaka&rsquo;ako home and make living their possible for only those who
can afford it. Along with the rising cost of living, these new urban
developments will destroy the cultural significance and history of
Kaka&rsquo;ako that was once present in the community. 
</p>
<p>	To understand the
effects and consequences of development in Kaka&rsquo;ako, we need to
understand this place as it was several years ago before European
contact. As mentioned earlier, Kaka&rsquo;ako was home to a thriving
Hawaiian community that included fishermen, agriculture terraces and
salt ponds. The neighborhood of Kaka&rsquo;ako has underwent many
different transformations since the Hawaiian Kingdom was still in
tact. In the early 1800&rsquo;s Honolulu Iron Works came to the
neighborhood bringing along many different immigrant groups and
industrial businesses alike. Along with the influx of businesses,
several different stores, churches and schools and parks were erected
for the residents of Kaka&rsquo;ako. This community would soon be
known for its blue collar work ethic while also establishing family
like ties within the community. But by about the mid 1950&rsquo;s,
Kaka&rsquo;ako was rezoned from residential to commercial allowing
many different warehouses and wholesalers to make this place their
home. This movement to commercial business displaced many residents
and started the act of urbanization that we currently relate to
Kaka&rsquo;ako today. In 1976, the State Legislature created the
Hawaii Community Development Authority (HCDA) and designated Kaka&rsquo;ako
as the authority's first Community Development District. This lead to
many developments involving high priced condominiums, restaurants,
and many other attractions to make Kaka&rsquo;ako what it is today.
There are several examples around Kaka&#699;ako that will reinforce
the notion that urbanization and development is helping to erase the
cultural and historical past of this community. My attempt will be to
highlight other places that help inform others about this argument
and show how the changing landscapes of Kaka&rsquo;ako are effecting
its cultural significance and the cost of living for many local
residents.</p>
<p>	The development of
Kaka&#699;ako is overseen and managed by the Hawaii Community
Development Authority. My first stop on my tour is specifically the
office where HCDA governmental branch is located. This stop
represents the role of this governmental agency plays in changing the
landscape of Kaka&rsquo;ako. According to the HCDA government
website, the agency was created in 1976 in order to determine what
areas had potential for development and were considered &ldquo;underused
and deteriorating&rdquo;. They specifically looked for opportunities
and places that would provide the greatest economic benefit. Kaka&rsquo;ako
was naturally one of the places that the HCDA targeted for
development. Since the 1990&rsquo;s, the HCDA has allocated around
217 million dollars in this district. They currently are working
closely with the two largest landowners in Kaka&rsquo;ako which
include Howard Hughes Corporation along with Kamehameha Schools. 
</p>
<p>My second stop will
reinforce the role of Howard Hughes Corporations has on Kaka&rsquo;ako
and their ability to change the physical dynamics of this place. This
corporation is extremely active in this area with regards to
construction especially with building luxury condominiums. This stop
is located at the Ward Village where development of luxury
Condominiums is currently going on. Howard Hughes corporation has and
continues to build luxury condos that will provide the community with
thousands of living space over the next several years. Under the
HCDA&rsquo;s supervision, they allowed developers such as Howard
Hughes to build several luxury condos that will likely price out many
local residents in the area. To combat this issue, the HCDA
implemented a system where developers are required to reserve 20
percent of its units for local buyers who earn no more than 140
percent of Honolulu&rsquo;s adjusted income. Although this might
sound intriguing for local residents, there are certain restrictions
placed upon first time buyers in these units. For example, if a buyer
wants to sell the unit in the first ten years, the HCDA has the right
of purchase at the current market rate. The HCDA also requires the
seller to sign an equity sharing agreement where any profit made from
the sell would have to be split between the seller and the government
agency. These barriers make it extremely difficult for first time
buyers to commit to living in Kaka&rsquo;ako.</p>
<p>	Walking through
Kaka&rsquo;ako today construction and development is extremely
prevalent in this once small town community. There is little evidence
of the traditional history once predominant in this place. My third
stop continues to show the changing dynamics in Kaka&rsquo;ako is the
Kewalo Basin. The Kewalo Basin is a man made harbor meant to divert
boat traffic from the congested Honolulu Harbor. It formerly
consisted of swamp land and was said to be the stop for many ancient
Hawaiian canoes and foreign ships visiting Hawai&rsquo;i. Throughout
the 1900&rsquo;s, the basin has been reconstructed several times to
eventually fit Honolulu&rsquo;s commercial fishing fleet, private
yachts and charter vessels that serve Hawaii&rsquo;s tourist fishing
market. Today the harbor consists of heavy boat traffic filled with
tourists and local fishermen who have little knowledge about the
history and significance of this place. There recently have been many
plans to develop the areas surrounding the harbor with retail shops
and restaurants which is still in the process of approval by the
Hawaii Community Development Authority. 
</p>
<p>Just down Ala Moana
Boulevard from Kewalo Basin is the Ala Moana shopping center. The
original name of the area was previously called K&#257;lia. According
to a story done by Hawaii News Now, early in the 1900&rsquo;s Ala
Moana center used to consist of fish ponds and taro plantations where
many different species of birds and fish were present. With the
erection of the shopping center the name K&#257;lia was lost and many
local families were displaced due to the new construction.<span lang="haw-US">
With regards to the shopping center itself,</span> it currently is
the largest open air shopping mall in all of the United States and
continues to expand. This place is significant to my argument because
it represents more than just a shopping mall. Ala Moana symbolizes a
capitalistic system once foreign to the islands that caters towards
the tourists coming to Oahu. This is evident by the way that stores
in the mall are strategically located. Most of the high end retail
stores are located on the first and second floors. This leaves fast
food restaurants and more local oriented stores in the basement of
the shopping center. Frequently, the mall will also have hula and
other native Hawaiian performances on the stage in the middle of the
center. This gives an inaccurate representation of Hawaiian culture
and what these performances truly mean. To have them in a shopping
center downplays the significance and history they hold. Currently
<span lang="haw-US">about forty-two million people visit the mall
every year making it one of the most popular destinantions in all of
Oahu. </span>
</p>
<p> 	The final major
stop on my tour is the Neal S. Blasdell Center. Before the Blaisdell
was built, Curtis and his wife Victoria Ward owned 100 acres in the
Kaka&rsquo;ako area including much of what we now know as Ward
Theatres. They built a southern style plantation and with his family
created a business of moving cargo on horse pulled wagons. This was
during the time when the Hawaiian Kingdom was being threatened by
other plantation owners. The Wards fought hard against other
plantation owners and firmly opposed reciprocity with United States.
After the overthrow, the Wards worked hard to maintain and preserve
Hawaiian Culture. They supported many organizations benefiting Native
Hawaiians and helped start the Humane Society in Hawaii. Before
Curtis and his wife passed away, they established the Victoria Ward
LTD to manage their planation. It was largely untouched until in 1958
the city purchased the remaining land held in the Ward name and the
Neal S. Blaidsell center was erected. In 2002, Chicago-based General
Growth Properties Inc (now the owner of Ala Moana Center) agreed to
buy Victoria Ward Ltd giving the corporation full control of one of
the state's largest private landowners and operator of a growing
retail complex in Kaka&#699;ako. The land has since been passed on to
Howard Hughes corporation. The importance of this stop is to
recognize how influential the Wards were I the community and their
opposition to the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. We all
recognize the Blaisdell center as it stands today but many of us fail
to recognize the history behind the land it sits on.</p>
<p>	Lastly, there are
many other places in Kaka&rsquo;ako that hold cultural and historical
significance not mentioned in the five major stops. Other places that
hold significance are Ward theatres, Ala Moana Beach Park and
Kaka&rsquo;ako Waterfront Park. All of these places are located very
close to each other and have similar historical backgrounds. Much
like the Kewalo Basin, these place once contained, agricultural
terraces, taro plantations, and salt ponds which are not found there
today. Both Ala Moana Beach Park and Kaka&rsquo;ako Waterfront Park
are now known for their current uses as recreational beaches and
parks.  With regards to Ward Theatres, this was also land held at one
time by the Ward family but later developed into one of the most
popular movie theatres in all of Oahu.</p>
<p>	Through
the Politics of Place Walking Tour, I wanted to try and educate
people who had no prior knowledge to land was like in Kaka&rsquo;ako
before urban development took place. I tried to emphasize the notion
that Kaka&rsquo;ako is more than just a place that the HCDA
designated as having potential to reap huge economic benefits for the
State of Hawai&rsquo;i and the island of Oahu, but one with cultural
and historical significance. I also wanted to stress some the the
consequences of building luxury condos and how it affects affordable
housing and the local population. But even though there are many
negative things associated with development, there are also many
opportunities made from it as well. Development here in Hawai&rsquo;i
puts money back into the local economy while employing several local
construction workers at the same time. As the HCDA Howard Hughes
Corp. moves forward, I hope they highlight the history of Kaka&rsquo;ako
and make a valiant effort to provide much needed housing to the local
population.</p>
